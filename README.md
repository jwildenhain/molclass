# Molclass version 1.7
##### MolClass holds relevant pharmacological and physiological models to improve high throughput of small molecules. Further it allows users to generate supervised machine learning models from small molecule datasets. To do so it is using structural features identified in hit and non-hit molecules. Currently there is full support of multi class models. The histogram display of models is currently restricted to two classes only.

## Update 17th September 2018
- New Models include Hepatocyte toxcicity, Log D prediction, Plasma Protein Binding, Solubility and Microsome toxcicity
- Molclass Wiki is being moved from the the MolClass server to GitHub. Find the Documentation on the Wiki tab.
- Extended REST features to extract compound information, structure, feature vectors, physiological properties and model predictions
- R snippets to retrieve MolClass REST results

The online version can be found on: http://sysbiolab.bio.ed.ac.uk/molclass/

## Update November 19th 2013
The new release has undergone some major improvements including a much faster structure search, new fingerprints, new machine
learning algorithms, an 85% similarity match and likelihood score distribution display. With the current version 1.5, 
biologically relevant Klekota-Roth fingerprints have been added to the learner. Further data is preclustered by Murcko-Fragments
and similarity calculated by enhanced connectivity fingerprints (ECFP) and Klekota-Roth fingerprints. The list of machine 
learners got extended including Bayesian and neuronal networks and majority vote/regression ensemble learning.

This repository contains the source and some of the dependencies. You can download the full software from the molclass server.
