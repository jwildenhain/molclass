# Molclass version 1.5
##### MolClass generates computational models from small molecule datasets using structural features identified in hit and non-hit molecules.

The online version can be found on: http://sysbiolab.bio.ed.ac.uk/molclass/

Update November 19th 2013
The new release has undergone some major improvements including a much faster structure search, new fingerprints, new machine
learning algorithms, an 85% similarity match and likelihood score distribution display. With the current version 1.5, 
biologically relevant Klekota-Roth fingerprints have been added to the learner. Further data is preclustered by Murcko-Fragments
and similarity calculated by enhanced connectivity fingerprints (ECFP) and Klekota-Roth fingerprints. The list of machine 
learners got extended including Bayesian and neuronal networks and majority vote/regression ensemble learning.

This repository contains the source and will lack some prerequisites. You can download the full software from the molclass server.
